# SingleLineShakeAnimation
TLDR; Shake a view with a single line of code with a non-intrusive extension for UIView, with good support for accessability, written in Swift.

With this non-intrusive UIView extension, your UIView subclasses can get shaking with very little code. 
Shaking can be useful to indicate an important action your user needs to perform, for example filling out a form before submitting. Show the user it by gently shaking the needed view to get their attention.

## Installation
```ruby
pod "SingleLineShakeAnimation"
```

Usage
=====
#### import library 
```swift
import SingleLineShakeAnimation
```

##### Basic horizontal shake
```swift
button.shake(.Horizontal)
```
##### Basic vertical shake
```swift
button.shake(.Vertical)
```
Using the default values, 5 times back and forth, animating for 0.5 seconds.

Customized usage
=====
Vertical shake with completion block.
```swift

            // do something after animation finishes
        })
```

Stating number of times to go back and forth and total duration for the whole animation to take.
```swift
button.shake(.Horizontal, numberOfTimes: 10, totalDuration: 0.6, completion: {
            // do something after animation finishes
        })
```

## Single Line APIs
Really good APIs should not need more than a single line of code to work and be as non intrusive as possible. This library is a part of my ongoing effort to build single line libraries for iOS. Check out the other ones on the list as well.
